## Agenda

* Warm-up activity: intro to logistic regression
* Plan for week 1 and the semester
* Syllabus highlights

# Data

Using information from the National Indonesia Contraceptive Prevalence Survey, we are interested in studying the relationship between an individual's age and whether or not they use contraceptives.

.footnote[
The data come from [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Contraceptive+Method+Choice](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Contraceptive+Method+Choice)
]

--

**Question:** Statistical models are typically used for one of three main goals: *association/inference* (understanding how variables are associated), *prediction* (predicting one variable from another), and *causal inference* (determining whether one variable causes another). What is our goal with the contraceptive data?

.abox[ 
Association/Inference
]

.bbox[
Prediction
]

.cbox[
Causal inference
]

--

**Answer:** We care about the relationship between age and contraceptive use, but we don't aim to draw causal conclusions, so our goal is *association/inference*

---

## Data

Information on 911 husband-wife couples, with wife aged between 20 and 35, and variables including:

* Contraceptive method used (0 = none, 1 = some use)
* Wife's age (in years)
* Husband's age (in years)
* Wife's education (1 = low, 2, 3, 4 = high)
* Husband's education (1 = low, 2, 3, 4 = high)
* Number of children ever born

---

## Data

**Research question:** What is the relationship between wife's age and the use of contraceptives?

**Response variable:** Contraceptive use (0 = no, 1 = yes)

**Explanatory variable:** Wife's age (in years)

---

## Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

What plot can we use to visualize the response (contraceptive use)?

.abox[ 
Boxplot
]

.bbox[
Histogram
]

.cbox[
Bar chart
]

.dbox[
Scatterplot
]

--

**Answer:** Bar chart

## Class activity, Part I

[https://sta279-s22.github.io/class_activities/ca_lecture1.html](https://sta279-s22.github.io/class_activities/ca_lecture1.html)

In the class activity, you'll start to explore the relationship between age and contraceptive use.

Spend a few minutes to do the following:

* Say hi to the people around you, introduce yourself
* Work in groups on Part I of the class activity (questions 1 -- 3)
* You don't need to submit your work

---

## Class activity

What is the (empirical) probability of contraceptive use?

`\(P(\text{Contraceptive use} = 1) =\)`

---

## Class activity

What is the (empirical) probability of contraceptive use?

`\(P(\text{Contraceptive use} = 1) = 561/911 \approx 0.616\)`

---

## Class activity

What is the (empirical) probability that a couple will use some contraception, given that the wife is 20 years old? What about if the wife is 30 years old?

`\(P(\text{Contraceptive use} = 1 | \text{Wife's age} = 20) =\)`

`\(P(\text{Contraceptive use} = 1 | \text{Wife's age} = 30) =\)`

---

## Class activity

What is the (empirical) probability that a couple will use some contraception, given that the wife is 20 years old? What about if the wife is 30 years old?

`\(P(\text{Contraceptive use} = 1 | \text{Wife's age} = 20) = 11/28 \approx 0.393\)`

`\(P(\text{Contraceptive use} = 1 | \text{Wife's age} = 30) = 41/64 \approx 0.641\)`

---

## Marginal and conditional probabilities

`\(P(\text{Contraceptive use} = 1 | \text{Wife's age} = x)\)` is called a *conditional* probability.


`\(P(\text{Contraceptive use} = 1)\)` is called a *marginal* probability.

---

## Odds

What are the (empirical) odds of contraceptive use, if the wife's age is 20 years old? 30 years old?

--

`\(\dfrac{P(\text{Contraceptive use} = 1 | \text{Wife's age} = 20)}{1 - P(\text{Contraceptive use} = 1 | \text{Wife's age} = 20)} = \dfrac{0.393}{1 - 0.393} = 0.647\)`

`\(\dfrac{P(\text{Contraceptive use} = 1 | \text{Wife's age} = 30)}{1 - P(\text{Contraceptive use} = 1 | \text{Wife's age} = 30)} = \dfrac{0.641}{1 - 0.641} = 1.786\)`

---

## Conceptual question

If the *odds* of an event are `\(&gt; 1\)`, what is true about the *probability* of that event?

.abox[
probability `\(&gt; 1\)`
]

.bbox[
probability `\(&gt; 0.25\)`
]

.cbox[
probability `\(&gt; 0.5\)`
]

.dbox[
probability `\(&gt; 0.75\)`
]

--

**Answer:** probability &gt; 0.5

---

## Conceptual question

Probabilities are always between 0 and 1. What range of values can *odds* take?

.abox[
Between 0 and 1
]

.bbox[
Between 0 and `\(\infty\)`
]

.cbox[
Between `\(-\infty\)` and `\(\infty\)`
]

.dbox[
Between 0 and 2
]

--

**Answer:** between 0 and `\(\infty\)`

---

## Class activity, Part II

Spend a few minutes working in groups on Part II of the class activity (questions 4 -- 6)

---

## Class activity

What range of values can the log odds take?

--

Between `\(-\infty\)` and `\(\infty\)`

---

## Conceptual question

If the *probability* of an event is `\(&gt; 0.5\)`, what is true about the log odds?

.abox[
log odds `\(&gt; 0\)`
]

.bbox[
log odds `\(&gt; 1\)`
]

.cbox[
log odds `\(&gt; 0.5\)`
]

.dbox[
log odds `\(&lt; 0\)`
]

--

**Answer:** log odds `\(&gt; 0\)`

---

## Class activity

True or false: if the log odds are an increasing function of `\(X\)`, then the probability is also an increasing function of `\(X\)`.

--

**True**

---

## Class activity

**Logistic regression:**
.center[
`\(\log \left( \dfrac{\pi}{1 - \pi} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Age}\)`
]

In general, why is it not appropriate to model the probability, or the odds, as a linear function of the predictor?

--

**Answer:** a linear function takes values between `\(-\infty\)` and `\(\infty\)`, so we need the left hand side to also take values between `\(-\infty\)` and `\(\infty\)`

---

## Extensions and late work

**Extensions:** You have a bank of **5** extension days, which you may use over the course of the semester. You may use either one or two days for a given assignment. *Additional extensions may be given, on an individual basis, in extenuating circumstances.*

**Late work:** An assignment will be marked off 20% for every 24 hours it is late (past the original due date).

Example: If an assignment is turned in:
* 30 minutes -- 24 hours late: lose 20% of points
* 24 -- 48 hours late: lose 40% of points.

If you know you cannot turn in an assignment (for instance, if you are ill or there is a family emergency), let me know before the assignment is due, and we will work something out. There will be no grade changes
after our last day of class.
