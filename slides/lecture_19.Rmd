### Agenda

.large[
* Masks
* Class activity from last time
* Lab 6
]

### Masks going forward

.large[
* I will be requesting that everyone wears a mask in class for the rest of the semester
  * I have heard from students across my classes that COVID infections, and the local COVID rate, impact their ability to return home at the end of the semester
* Please be respectful of others' choices. Do not ask "Why are/aren't you wearing a mask?"
* My office will remain a masked space
  * If you prefer not to mask, we can meet over Zoom or outdoors

### Class activity from last time

.large[
$$Price_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Satisfaction_{ij} + u_i + \varepsilon_{ij}$$
$u_i \overset{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma_u^2) \hspace{1cm} \varepsilon_{ij} \overset{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma_\varepsilon^2)$

where $Price_{ij}$ is the price of rental $j$ in neighborhood $i$.

* $\widehat{\beta}_0 = 27.28$
* $\widehat{\beta}_1 = 14.81$

.question[
How would I interpret $\widehat{\beta}_0$ and $\widehat{\beta}_1$?

### Class activity from last time

.large[
$$Price_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Satisfaction_{ij} + u_i + \varepsilon_{ij}$$
$u_i \overset{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma_u^2) \hspace{1cm} \varepsilon_{ij} \overset{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma_\varepsilon^2)$

where $Price_{ij}$ is the price of rental $j$ in neighborhood $i$.

* $\widehat{\beta}_0 = 27.28$
* $\widehat{\beta}_1 = 14.81$

On average (across neighborhoods), we expect that the price of rental with 0 overall satisfaction is $27.28.

For a fixed neighborhood, an increase of 1 point in overall satisfaction is associated with an increase of $14.81 in rental price.

$$Price_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Satisfaction_{ij} + u_i + \varepsilon_{ij}$$
$u_i \overset{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma_u^2) \hspace{1cm} \varepsilon_{ij} \overset{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma_\varepsilon^2)$

where $Price_{ij}$ is the price of rental $j$ in neighborhood $i$.

$\widehat{\rho}_{group} = \dfrac{\widehat{\sigma}_u^2}{\widehat{\sigma}_u^2 + \widehat{\sigma}_\varepsilon^2} = \dfrac{1048}{1048 + 6762} = 0.134$

.question[
How do I interpret this estimated intra-class correlation?
]

.large[
About 13% of the variability in price can be explained by differences in the average price between neighborhoods (after accounting for overall satisfaction).

### Lab 6

.large[
Practice with mixed effects models (and a bit of maximum likelihood estimation)
